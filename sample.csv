12301, singapore new delhi  reuters    when a  year old bollywood actress took to social media this week alleging she was sexually assaulted on an airplane  she appeared to catch the airline industry off guard  her allegations   denied by the man accused of the assault on a domestic vistara flight in india   triggered online outrage and prompted a rare police investigation  the incident  coming shortly after facebook founder mark zuckerberg s sister randi  a silicon valley executive  said via social media that she had been a victim of sexual harassment on an alaska airlines flight  highlights a risk to airlines  they need to do more than just respond once an incident goes public and their brand comes under fire   it s a global issue and every country has to deal with the fallout   said saj ahmad  a london based analyst at strategic aero research   being prepared to address passenger concerns rather than being reactive to social media complaints will arguably help address these problems in real time   most people reuters contacted about in flight sexual misconduct  against passengers and crew   including airlines  flight attendant unions and airline training consultants   said incidents are vastly under reported  last year  according to the international air transport association  iata   airlines globally reported just  instances of  inappropriate sexual behavior   that s among 3 8 billion passengers on more than  million flights  in a statement  iata said fewer than half those cases were reported to the authorities  which is why there are so few police investigations   victims are required to press charges  the airline can t do that for them   said taylor garland  spokeswoman for the u s  association of flight attendants   we believe under reporting occurs   andrew herdman  director general of the association of asia pacific airlines  said the iata data needs to be viewed with caution  as event descriptions are not always standardized  and there are  significant variations in the level of voluntary reporting by airlines    with regard to incidents involving sexual harassment  ranging from verbal intimidation to actual physical assault  these are relatively rare  but always taken seriously   he said  among nearly two dozen major airlines contacted by reuters  only japan airlines co ltd gave actual figures on incidents of sexual harassment on its flights  around   a year  with police called in on some cases  suhaila hassan  head of cabin crew at malaysia based budget airline airasia bhd  said there had been no reported cases of passenger on passenger harassment  though there were occasional instances of cabin crew being harassed  she said it was possible some incidents were not reported to the airline   that could be the case because of the culture  people feel shy and embarrassed if revealed   she said  the airlines  comments fit with broader studies that estimate three of every four sexual harassment incidents in the workplace in united states go unreported  in asia  there s less of a culture of public discourse on sexual harassment   we tend to have a culture where     people don t generally speak up   said jason tan  a former singapore airlines flight attendant who works as a consultant training cabin crews in asia and the middle east   victims tend to suffer in silence   elsamarie d silva  a former flight attendant at jet airways  now runs a website crowdsourcing cases of sexual harassment and abuse  she said cases are under reported in india because of the associated shame and a culture where the onus is on the victim to prove the allegations   the time has come for indian aviation to take this more seriously   she said  most airlines train their cabin crews to deal with a broad category of  unruly passenger incidents    ranging from physical abuse and obscene behavior to verbal threats and tampering with aircraft equipment   crews are trained in these incidents  but to a limited extent   said philip baum  managing director of green light  an aviation security training firm and consultancy   most cabin crew security courses around the world are completed in one day  some take two days  there are so many scenarios  you could spend a week just going through all the types of unruly passenger   according to iata  a third of almost   unruly passenger incidents reported last year involved intoxication  just 2 percent were of inappropriate sexual behavior   while such incidents are rare  our crew are highly trained to manage any situation which may be dangerous or threatening   said a spokeswoman for european budget airline easyjet  american airlines recently decided to provide  enhanced  training in sexual harassment matters as part of a broader diversity and inclusion drive  a spokeswoman said  declining to give further details  and united airlines ceo oscar munoz this week told the carrier s over   employees there was  zero tolerance  for sexual harassment of customers or staff  according to a memo on the airline s website  but he did not specify any extra training  a survey by the u s  association of flight attendants this year found a fifth of cabin crew respondents had experienced a passenger to passenger assault while working on a flight  the union has expressed concern that policies related to passenger sexual misconduct are rarely highlighted  more than half those surveyed said they had no knowledge of specific policies  the same appears to apply in india  too  said satvik varma  a new delhi based independent litigation lawyer   there s no lack of regulations   he said   what we re grappling with here is a lack of implementation and a lack of knowledge of these regulations   ,0
